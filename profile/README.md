## Welcome to the Nirmal Lab
Our lab now focuses on the computational integration of omics data for probing the tumor microenvironment in skin cancers. We make use of innovative methodologies such as highly multiplexed imaging, micro-regional RNA sequencing and 3D high resolution imaging to investigate how the tumor microenvironment is remodeled during cancer development and drug exposure. 

### We conduct research in three major areas:
- AI/ML Methods
- Tumor Ecosystem
- Personalized Medicine

### Join Us:
Postdocs and students who would like to join the lab please email [nirmallab [at] bwh.harvard.edu] us your CV, a short statement of why you would like to work with us and your future goals. Check out our latest [vacancies](https://nirmallab.com/vacancy/).
